"LibroTrack: A Python-Based Library Management System"

LibroTrack is a simple yet efficient command-line-based Library Management System built using Python. It provides essential functionalities such as adding books, viewing available books, borrowing and returning books, searching for specific books, and removing books from the collection. The system ensures persistent storage of books using a JSON file (library.json), making it easy to maintain records even after the program is closed. The system offers a user-friendly menu interface that allows users to interact seamlessly with the library. Each book is tracked with its title, author, and availability status, ensuring an organized lending process. Users can search for books by title or author, and borrowed books are marked accordingly. The system is designed to handle user input effectively by validating choices and preventing incorrect operations. Future enhancements may include adding a GUI, user authentication, and an advanced filtering system to improve usability. This project is ideal for beginners learning Python and working with file handling, JSON storage, and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.
